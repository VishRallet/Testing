Great! Let's start with the ER Diagram (Entity Relationship Diagram) and then outline the Backend API Contract (with endpoints, methods, and descriptions).

🧩 ER Diagram (Entities + Relationships)
Here's a high-level breakdown of the core entities and their relationships:

📘 Entities & Relationships
[User]
- id (PK)
- name
- email (unique)
- password
- phone
- role (USER / ADMIN)

[Plan]
- id (PK)
- name
- type (DATA / VOICE / COMBO)
- validity
- price
- description

[Recharge]
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK → User)
- plan_id (FK → Plan)
- date
- amount
- status (SUCCESS / FAILED)

[Complaint]
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK → User)
- title
- description
- status (OPEN / IN_PROGRESS / RESOLVED)
- created_at
- resolved_at

[Usage]
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK → User)
- data_used (in MB)
- minutes_used
- date

[Invoice]
- id (PK)
- recharge_id (FK → Recharge)
- generated_at
- pdf_url (optional if storing)

Relationships:

A User can have many Recharges, Complaints, Usages

A Recharge is associated with a Plan and generates an Invoice

You said:
how will i handle usage, if i don't have access to all the applications accessing internet?
ChatGPT said:
Excellent and very practical question.

You're absolutely right — as a telecom portal developer, you won't have direct access to user application-level internet usage, especially if you're not the telecom service provider capturing real network traffic.

So let’s clarify this:

❓ Problem Context
Usage tracking (data/minutes) is typically done at the telecom operator/network level — e.g., tracking how much data a user used from their SIM or how many minutes they spent on calls.

But in your case, you're just building a customer portal, not a telecom core system. So unless this system integrates directly with a telecom backend (like HLR/HSS, charging system, or CDRs), you won’t have real usage data.

✅ Solution Options (Realistic Approaches)
Option 1: Simulated Usage Data (for MVP/demo)
For now (especially during development or MVP stage), you can simulate usage based on:

Plan limits (e.g., 10GB/month)

Random or rule-based consumption (e.g., daily decrease)

Recharge history as a trigger

How to implement:

On recharge, generate a Usage record with:

data_limit, minutes_limit

Auto-reduce usage daily via a cron job

Or allow the user to "simulate" usage

This allows the UI to show realistic-looking data like:

"You've used 2.3GB of 10GB"
"Remaining minutes: 125 of 200"

✅ Good for demo, mock data, testing UX

Option 2: Integration with Telecom Operator APIs
If you're working with or for a real telecom company, they likely have internal APIs or data sources for:

CDRs (Call Detail Records)

Data charging records

Usage metering systems

In this case, your backend can pull or receive usage data via:

REST APIs

FTP batch jobs

Kafka queues (for streaming usage events)

But this depends on the telco giving you access. These are typically internal systems.

✅ Best for production deployments, real-time or near-real-time insights

Option 3: Manual Usage Entry (for dev only)
For testing purposes, allow admin or dev users to manually create/edit usage records in your database.

📦 Suggested Usage Table Schema
CREATE TABLE usage (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT,
    data_used_mb DECIMAL,
    minutes_used INT,
    date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
You can prefill this table with dummy data or update it via scheduled jobs.

🧠 Summary
Method	Use Case	Notes
Simulated usage	MVP, mock UX	Best for demos or early-stage builds
Integration with operator	Real-world deployments	Requires telecom-side cooperation
Manual entry	Dev testing	Not scalable but useful early on
If you'd like, I can help you write a Java service to simulate usage data over time (e.g., reduce data daily). Want that?

You said:
cron job

what is this?
ChatGPT said:
Great — let me explain that clearly.

⏰ What is a Cron Job?
A cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specific intervals (e.g., every hour, daily, weekly). It's like setting an alarm clock for your code.

It’s often used to run scripts or background processes — like cleaning up expired sessions, sending daily reports, or in your case: updating usage data every day.

🧠 In the Context of Your Project
Imagine your system simulates usage data for each user (like data consumption or minutes used). Since you’re not getting that from a real network, you could:

Run a cron job every 24 hours.

That job would go through each user's plan and decrease their available data/minutes a little bit.

This gives the impression that usage is happening daily.

💻 How to Do This in Spring Boot
Spring Boot supports scheduled tasks using the @Scheduled annotation.

✅ Example:
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class UsageSimulator {

    // This method runs once a day at midnight
    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?")
    public void simulateUsage() {
        // Logic: fetch all active users and plans
        // Reduce their data/minutes randomly
        System.out.println("Simulating daily usage...");
    }
}
🛠️ Enable Scheduling in Spring Boot
In your main application class:

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class TelecomPortalApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(TelecomPortalApplication.class, args);
    }
}
🕒 Cron Expression Explained
"0 0 0 * * ?" → Every day at midnight
Format:

second minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
Other examples:

"0 0 * * * *" → every hour

"0 */10 * * * *" → every 10 minutes

✅ When You Might Use Cron Jobs in This Project
Task	When to Use a Cron Job
Simulate usage data daily	✅ Every day at midnight
Clean up expired tokens/sessions	✅ Every hour/day
Generate daily analytics snapshot	✅ Daily or hourly
